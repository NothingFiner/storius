A peach face; a death mask. If you look closely you can see\\nIt is the same face, & the boy, murdering the man, is murdering his own boyhood,\\nHis robe open & exposing a bare left shoulder. In 1603, it meant he was available,\\nFor sale on the street where Ranuccio Tomassoni is falling, & Caravaggio,\\nPuzzled that a man would die so easily, turns & runs.\\nWasn't it like this, after all? And this self-portrait, David holding him by a lock\\nOf hair? Couldn't it destroy time if he offered himself up like this, empurpled,\\nBloated, the crime paid for in advance? To die before one dies, & keep painting?\\nThis town, & that town, & exile? I stood there looking at it a long time.\\nA man whose only politics was rage. By 1970, tinted orchards & mass graves.\\n                                                           ~\\nThe song that closed the Fillmore was \\\"Johnny B. Goode,\\\" as Garcia played it,\\nWithout regret, the doors closing forever & the whole Haight evacuated, as if\\nWaiting for the touch of the renovator, for the new boutiques that would open—\\nThe patina of sunset glinting in the high, dark windows.\\nOnce, I marched & linked arms with other exiles who wished to end a war, & . . .\\nSometimes, walking in that crowd, I became the crowd, &, for that moment, it felt\\nLike entering the wide swirl & vortex of history. In the end,\\nOf course, you could either stay & get arrested, or else go home.\\nIn the end, of course, the war finished without us in an empty row of horse stalls\\nLittered with clothing that had been confiscated.\\n                                                           ~\\nI had a friend in high school who looked like Caravaggio, or like Goliath—\\nEspecially when he woke at dawn on someone's couch. (In early summer,\\nIn California, half the senior class would skinny-dip & drink after midnight\\nIn the unfinished suburb bordering the town, because, in the demonstration models,\\nThey finished the pools before the houses sold. . . . Above us, the lush stars thickened.)\\nTwo years later, thinking he heard someone call his name, he strolled three yards\\nOff a path & stepped on a land mine.\\n                                                           ~\\nTime's sovereign. It rides the backs of names cut into marble. And to get\\nBack, one must descend, as if into a mass grave. All along the memorial, small\\nOfferings, letters, a bottle of bourbon, photographs, a joint of marijuana slipped\\nInto a wedding ring. You see, you must descend; it is one of the styles\\nOf Hell. And it takes a while to find the name you might be looking for; it is\\nMeant to take a while. You can touch the names, if you want to. You can kiss them,\\nYou can try to tease out some final meaning with your lips.\\nThe boy who was standing next to me said simply: \\\"You can cry. . . . It's O.K., here.\\\"\\n                                                           ~\\n\\\"Whistlers,\\\" is what they called them. A doctor told me who'd worked the decks\\nOf a hospital ship anchored off Seoul. You could tell the ones who wouldn't last\\nBy the sound, sometimes high-pitched as a coach's whistle, the wind made going\\nThrough them. I didn't believe him at first, & so then he went into greater\\nDetail. . . . Some evenings, after there had been heavy casualties & a brisk wind,\\nHe'd stare off a moment & think of a farm in Nebraska, of the way wheat\\nBent in the wind below a slight rise, & no one around for miles. All he wanted,\\nHe told me, after working in such close quarters for twelve hours, for sixteen\\nHours, was that sudden sensation of spaciousness—wind, & no one there.\\nMy friend, Zamora, used to chug warm vodka from the bottle, then execute a perfect\\nReverse one-&-a-half gainer from the high board into the water. Sometimes,\\nWhen I think of him, I get confused. Someone is calling to him, & then\\nI'm actually thinking of Caravaggio . . . in his painting. I want to go up to it\\nAnd close both the eyelids. They are still half open & it seems a little obscene\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"color\":\"#000000\"},\"insert\":\"To leave them like that.\"},{\"insert\":\" \\n\"}]}")
