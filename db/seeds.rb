Above us, the lush stars thickened.)\\nTwo years later, thinking he heard someone call his name, he strolled three yards\\nOff a path & stepped on a land mine.\\n                                                           ~\\nTime's sovereign. It rides the backs of names cut into marble. And to get\\nBack, one must descend, as if into a mass grave.
